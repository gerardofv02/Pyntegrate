    """
    Compares two genomic signal objects and outputs results as a bedGraph file.
    Can be used for entire genome-wide comparisons due to its parallel nature.

    Typical usage would be to create genome-wide windows of equal size to
    provide as `features`::

        windowsize = 10000
        features = pybedtools.BedTool().window_maker(
           genome='hg19', w=windowsize)

    You will usually want to choose bins for the array based on the final
    resolution you would like. Say you would like 10-bp bins in the final
    bedGraph; using the example above you would use array_kwargs={'bins':
    windowsize/10}.  Or, for single-bp resolution (beware: file will be large),
    use {'bins': windowsize}.

    Here's how it works.  This function:

        * Takes `batchsize` features at a time from `features`

        * Constructs normalized (RPMMR) arrays in parallel for each input
          genomic signal object for those `batchsize` features

        * Applies `comparefunc` (np.subtract by default) to the arrays to get
          a "compared" (e.g., difference matrix by default) for the `batchsize`
          features.

        * For each row in this matrix, it outputs each nonzero column as
          a bedGraph format line in `outfn`

    `comparefunc` is a function with the signature::

        def f(x, y):
            return z

    where `x` and `y` will be arrays for `signal1` and `signal2` (normalized to
    RPMMR) and `z` is a new array.  By default this is np.subtract, but another
    common `comparefunc` might be a log2-fold-change function::

        def lfc(x, y):
            return np.log2(x / y)

    :param signal1: A genomic_signal object
    :param signal2: Another genomic_signal object
    :param features: An iterable of pybedtools.Interval objects. A list will be
        created for every `batchsize` features, so you need enough memory for
        this.
    :param comparefunc: Function to use to compare arrays (default is
        np.subtract)
    :param outfn: String filename to write bedGraph file
    :param batchsize: Number of features (each with length `windowsize` bp) to
        process at a time
    :param array_kwargs: Kwargs passed directly to genomic_signal.array.  Needs
        `processes` and `chunksize` if you want parallel processing
    :param verbose: Be noisy
